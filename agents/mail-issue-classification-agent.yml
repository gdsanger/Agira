  - Email sender\r\n- Email subject\r\n- Email body\r\n\r\nYour task:\r\n1. Analyze\
  \ the email content to determine which project it belongs to\r\n2. Determine the\

  \ object with the following structure (no other text):\r\n\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"\
  bug|feature|idea|task\",\r\n  \"project\": \"Name of project from context\"\r\n\
  }\r\n\r\nGuidelines:\r\n- If you can confidently match the email to a project, include\
  \ the project name\r\n- If you cannot confidently match to any project, omit the\
  \ \"project\" field or set it to null\r\n- Choose the most appropriate type based\
  \ on email content:\r\n  * \"bug\" - for problem reports, errors, issues\r\n  *\
  \ \"feature\" - for new functionality requests\r\n  * \"idea\" - for suggestions,\
  \ proposals, brainstorming\r\n  * \"task\" - for general work items, questions,\
  \ or unclear requests\r\n- If type is unclear, use \"task\" as default\r\n- Project\
  \ name MUST exactly match one from the context list (case-sensitive)\r\n\r\nOutput\
  \ ONLY valid JSON, nothing else."
